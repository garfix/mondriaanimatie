# Algorithm

A Mondriaan-like painting can be constructed like this:

## Set up

Consider the frame as a set of four lines and as a single room.

## Steps

Take one of the following steps:

1. Take two parallel lines and draw a perpendicular line between them; this divides one or more rooms into twice as many of them.
2. Same as step 1, but using two thin parallel lines quite next to each other
2. Create a plane from a room.
3. Create a number of steps in an elongated room that borders a frame.

Now repeat this process a random number of times.
