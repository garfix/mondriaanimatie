# Composition

What can be said about composition? It is about rhythm and harmony. It may not be possible to generate these by computer. But we must give it a try.

## Colored planes

Use of zero colors occurs. Here are some common combinations:

1 color:
- red
- blue
- yellow

2 colors:
- black, grey
- red, grey
- red, blue
- red, black
- yellow, red
- yellow, blue

3 colors:
- red, yellow, blue
- grey, yellow, blue
- black, red, gray
- black, yellow, blue

4 colors:
- red, yellow, blue, black

5 colors:
- red, yellow, blue, black, grey

Using more than 5 colors create crowded paintings, I think.

A deeply nested element may be the focus of a painting: the single plane.
